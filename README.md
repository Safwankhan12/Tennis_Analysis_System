# Tennis Analysis System

## Introduction
This project analyzes Tennis players in a video to measure their speed, ball shot speed and number of shots. This project will detect players and the tennis ball using YOLO and also utilizes CNNs to extract court keypoints.





## Objectives
Objectives:
1) Develop algorithms to accurately track player movement and ball trajectory in tennis matches.


2) Implement machine learning models to analyze player performance metrics such as serve speed, shot placement, and rally patterns.


3) Create a predictive model to forecast match outcomes based on historical data and current game dynamics.


4) Integrate computer vision techniques to identify player gestures and expressions for emotional analysis and performance evaluation.


5) Continuously refine and update the AI/ML algorithms to stay current with advancements in tennis analytics and technology.


## Technologies used
1) Pytorch (Building Deep Learning Models)


2) Opencv  (Image processing)


3) Yolo8 (Player detection)


4) Pandas  (Data handling)


5) Numpy  (Arrays)


6) Ultralytics (Creating and deploying machine learning models)


7) Python 3.8


## Expected Outcomes
The AI/ML tennis analysis system aims to revolutionize the way tennis is understood and played. By accurately tracking player movements and ball trajectories, analyzing performance metrics, and predicting match outcomes, the system will provide invaluable insights for players, coaches, and enthusiasts alike. Expectations include improved player training strategies, enhanced tactical decision-making during matches, and a deeper understanding of the game's nuances.
